Every function also has an inverse. The inverse of a function is the new relationship created when the input and the output are switched. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>One of the best examples for illustrating inverses is the function that relates Fahrenheit to Celsius temperatures. F=<sup>9</sup>/<sub>5</sub>C+32 is the equation used to convert Celsius temperatures to Fahrenheit temperatures. &nbsp;Celsius is the input and Fahrenheit is the output. The inverse equation for this is C=<sup>5</sup>/<sub>9</sub>(F-32). &nbsp;This equation will convert Fahrenheit temperatures to Celsius temperatures. The input and output have switched locations. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>If a function contains the ordered pair (x,y), then the inverse of the function must contain the ordered pair (y,x).</p>\r\n<p>Last but not least, when graphed the inverse of a function appears as a reflection of the function over the line y=x.</p>\r\n<p>In this activity you will learn how to find inverses of discrete and continuous functions, how to determine whether or not the inverse of a function is also a function, and how to graph the inverse of a function by reflecting it over the line y=x.</p>",

  Note: User agent sniffing does not provide guaranteed results and spoofing may

  Based on the unit test samples, the most stable browser properties appear to
  be `engine` and `engineVersion`.
