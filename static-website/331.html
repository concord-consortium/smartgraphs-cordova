  This object contains information about the browser environment SproutCore is
  running in. This includes the following properties:

    - browser.device                  ex. SC.DEVICE.ipad
    - browser.name                    ex. SC.BROWSER.chrome
    - browser.version                 ex. '16.0.2.34'
    - browser.os                      ex. SC.OS.mac
    - browser.osVersion               ex. '10.6'
    - browser.engine                  ex. SC.ENGINE.webkit
    - browser.engineVersion           ex. '533.29'

  Note: User agent sniffing does not provide guaranteed results and spoofing may
  affect the accuracy.  Therefore, as a general rule, it is much better
  to rely on the browser's verified capabilities in SC.platform.

  Based on the unit test samples, the most stable browser properties appear to
  be `engine` and `engineVersion`.
