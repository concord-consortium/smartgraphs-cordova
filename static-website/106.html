  This object contains information about the browser environment SproutCore is

    - browser.name                    ex. SC.BROWSER.chrome

    - browser.engineVersion           ex. '533.29'

  Note: User agent sniffing does not provide guaranteed results and spoofing may
  affect the accuracy.  Therefore, as a general rule, it is much better
  to rely on the browser's verified capabilities in SC.platform.

  Based on the unit test samples, the most stable browser properties appear to
  be `engine` and `engineVersion`.
